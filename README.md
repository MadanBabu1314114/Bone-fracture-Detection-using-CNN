## Overview

This project focuses on the detection of bone fractures using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of fractured and non-fractured X-ray images of various joints. The task is to build a robust image classifier capable of accurately detecting fractures in given X-ray images.

**Dataset Source:** This dataset comprises fractured and non-fractured X-ray images of several joints. It is recommended to isolate individual joints for enhanced classifier performance. 

## Dataset

The dataset is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vuppalaadithyasairam/bone-fracture-detection-using-xrays). Please ensure that you adhere to the dataset's licensing and usage terms.
